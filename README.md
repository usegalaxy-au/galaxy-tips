# Galaxy tips

A series of Galaxy tips to be displayed to users with the galaxy-tips webhook.

- Tips are written in plain HTML (with access to Galaxy's UI libraries like Bootstrap) with files named in numeric series like `<n>.html`.
- Images can be added to [./static/img/](./static/img/) but must be referenced with a full GitHub raw URL. See tip [1.html](./tips/1.html) for an example.
